##  Launching an Attack from Another PC in the LAN:
 
We start by launching the CSRF attack in DVWA with the security level set to 'low'. This allows us to observe how the attack is structured and executed. To do this, we send a request to change the user's password as a test, demonstrating how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability.
