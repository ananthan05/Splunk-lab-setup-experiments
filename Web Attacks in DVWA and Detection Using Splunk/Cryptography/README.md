Objective:To forge a valid session token with elevated privileges (e.g., admin access) by exploiting the deterministic nature of AES-128-ECB, where blocks are encrypted independently and can be rearranged without affecting decryption.

### Understanding the Vulnerability-

We now have **three tokens**:
- One for the **admin**
- One for a **valid user**
- One for a **session-expired user**

Our goal is to **log in as the admin** by analyzing and manipulating these tokens.

We aim to:
1. Extract the **valid session ID** from the valid user's token.
2. Extract **admin privileges** from the adminâ€™s token.
3. Replace corresponding blocks in the expired token with the above.

By doing this, we can forge a **new token** that has:
- A valid session
- Admin-level access

###  ðŸ§ª Methodology

This works because the tokens are encrypted using **AES-128-ECB**, which encrypts each 16-byte block independently. That means:
- Identical plaintext blocks = identical ciphertext blocks.
- Blocks can be swapped between tokens encrypted with the same key.

### Token Swapping Steps:

1. **Identify blocks** in each token by splitting them into 16-byte (32 hex char) chunks.
2. Determine which blocks represent:
   - Session ID
   - Role or privileges
3. Swap relevant blocks into the expired token.
4. Use the forged token to log in as admin.

## ðŸ§° Prerequisite

To make the token analysis easier, install **Sublime Text**:

### Installation (Linux)

```
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
```

```
curl -fsSL https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-pub.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/sublimehq-archive.gpg
```

```
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/sublimehq-archive.gpg] https://download.sublimetext.com/ apt/stable/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sublime-text.list
```

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sublime-text
```

Now we anlyis the tokens from the **Sublime Text**. 

open it using the command 

```
subl
```
Then paste the three token there.

### Token Splitting Using Sublime Text (AES Block Viewer)

To analyze AES-128-ECB encrypted tokens, it's useful to break the ciphertext into **32-character chunks** (each representing a 16-byte AES block). Hereâ€™s how to do that using **Sublime Text**:

---

###  1. Open the Replace Panel
- Navigate to `Find â†’ Replace...`  
- Or use the shortcut: `Ctrl + H` 

---

###  2. Enable Regex Mode
- Look at the bottom left of the Find/Replace panel.
- Click the `.*` button to turn on **Regular Expression Mode**.

> It should turn **orange** when active.

---

### ðŸ§  3. Use These Fields:

**Find:**  
```regex
([0-9a-fA-F]{32})
```
This matches exactly 32 hexadecimal characters â€“ one full AES block.

Replace:

```regex
\1\n
```

This keeps the match and adds a newline after every 32-character block.

and press replace all button.

###  Block Index Mapping

| Block Index | Description       | Notes                            |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| `0`         | **Username**       | First block of each token        |
| `1`         | **Expiry**         | Usually reused among tokens      |
| `2`         | **Privilege level**| User/Admin privileges             |
| `3+`        | **Bio/Extra**      | Arbitrary or user-controlled data |

From my analysis, I understood that I need to change Sweep's session token to match Soo's, because Soo has a valid session token. Since Sweep and the admin share the same session structure, replacing Sweep's expired session block with Soo's valid one allows me to craft a valid session token with admin privileges
